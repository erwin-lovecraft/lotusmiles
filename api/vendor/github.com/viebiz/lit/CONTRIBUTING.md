### üßπ Code Style

- Use `gofmt` before committing (`go fmt ./...`)
- Use clear, descriptive naming (e.g., `NewHandler`, `WithConfig`)
- Keep functions short and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### ‚úÖ Testing

- All logic **must** be covered by **unit tests**
- Use table-driven tests where applicable
- Mock external dependencies to keep tests isolated
- Run `make test` and ensure all tests pass locally

---

- This project uses **automated CI** to run tests on each **Pull Request (PR) and Merge Request (MR)**
- **Only PRs with all tests passing will be eligible for approval**
- The CI pipeline includes:
    - Code formatting/linting
    - Unit test execution
    - Build validation
